# Contributing

When contributing to this project, please first discuss the change you wish to make via GitHub discussions, an issue or an informal option such as the Slack community.

We don't currently have a dedicated code of conduct however, it is expected that you treat everyone with respect in the community.

Any feedback for the contributing workflows whether it be the branch structure, coding style, tests or general feedback of the implementation is welcome and should be brought up either as a discussion/issue or informally over a chat like Slack. Do not use emails/GitHub Issues for informal discussions.
